# HW5

## Problem
Perform a classification task on the `Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set` provided by `UCI`, using different classification algorithms and comparing their performance.

## Resources
The dataset for this problem is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Solution
A total of 5 algorithms are used to solve this problem. They are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNeighbors

Also, I used the implementation of the above algorithms from the `scikit-learn` library. All codes and comparison details are available in the `Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Smartphones_Data_Set.ipynb` file.
