## Problem
Implement proposed algorithm in the paper:

> Moradi, P., & Gholampour, M. (2016). A hybrid particle swarm optimization for feature subset selection by integrating a novel local search strategy. Applied Soft Computing, 43, 117-130


## Resources
Paper is available [Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494616300321).

Authors has named their algorithm as `Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Local Search` or `HPOS-LS`.

Proposed algorithm has 6 steps and a step-by-step implementation of the algorithm is available in `PapersImplementation.ipynb` in details.
