# AI-Homeworks
My answers to homeworks of AI course at Amirkabir University of Technology taught by Dr. Mehdi Ghatee and M.S. Rouhollah Ahmadian.

Total of 7 homeworks were given in this course. Each homework has a different topic and I tried to solve all of them and I hope you find them useful. 

## Summary

Briefly, the homeworks were as follows:
- `Homework 1`: Gather information and study about methods of Artificial Intelligence.
- `Homework 2`: Solve N-Queens problem using different heuristic functions and compare them.
- `Homework 3`: Implement a 2-player game using Minimax algorithm.
- `Homework 4`: Solve Graph Coloring problem as a CSP.
- `Homework 5`: Apply different classification algorithms on UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset and compare the results.
- `Homework 6`: Perform classification task on **IRIS** dataset using neural networks and different optimization algorithms and compare the results.
- `Homework 7`: Implement **HPSO-LS** algorithm from the paper's instructions and compare the results with **PSO** algorithm.

`HW1` and `HW2` are written in Persian, so I have written a brief description of these 2 homeworks in English in README.md file of each homework's folder.
