# AI-Homeworks
My assignments for homework for the AI course at Amirkabir University of Technology taught by Dr. Mehdi Ghatee and M.S. Rouhollah Ahmadian.

A total of 7 homework were given in this course. Each assignment has a different topic, and I tried to solve all of them, and I hope you find them useful. 

## Summary

Briefly, the homework was as follows:
- `Homework 1`: Gather information and study about methods of Artificial Intelligence.
- `Homework 2`: Solve and compare the N-Queens problem using different heuristic functions.
- `Homework 3`: Implement a 2-player game using the Minimax algorithm.
- `Homework 4`: Solve Graph Coloring problem as a CSP.
- `Homework 5`: Apply different classification algorithms on the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset and compare the results.
- `Homework 6`: Perform classification task on **IRIS** dataset using neural networks and different optimization algorithms and compare the results.
- `Homework 7`: Implement the **HPSO-LS** algorithm from the paper's instructions and compare the results with the **PSO** algorithm.

`HW1` and `HW2` are in Persian, so I have written a brief description of these two homework in English in the README.md file of each homework folder.
