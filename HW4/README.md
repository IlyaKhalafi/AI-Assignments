## Problem
Solve `Map Coloring Problem` as a CSP using one of the CSP solvers.

## Solution
I chose `Min Conflict Solver` to solve this problem.

All codes including implementation of CSP, Graphs and Solver are available under `Codes` directory. Also procedure and logic of implementation is described in `GraphColoringCSP.ipynb` in details.
