# HW4

## Problem
Solve `Map Coloring Problem` as a CSP using one of the CSP solvers.

## Solution
I chose `Min Conflict Solver` to solve this problem.

All codes, including implementation of CSP, Graphs, and Solver, are available under the `Codes` directory. Also, the procedure and logic of implementation are described in `GraphColoringCSP.ipynb` in detail.
